// Tic Tac Toe!

//1. Make a grid that is 3 by 3 
//done with html

//2. Create two different variables.


//3. Variables should be X and O


//4. Player 1 gets X  consistent
//5. player 2 gets O   consistent
//6. This must be consistant throughout the entire game!
//7. Each player will have their own turn, player 1 will put their variable of choice on the grid, by clicking on any square of their choice that does not already have a variable on.  
//8. Once player 1 selects their square of choice, it is now player 2 turn.
//9. Player 2 can now select to put their varialble on the grid. They can only select a square that does not have a variable already on it.
//10. Each player can have up to 3 turns.
//11. Optional, maybe put an alert that says whos turn it is. Also, maybe add another alert that stops a player from cliking anything if it is not their turn.
//12. Alert  when game ends. If there is a winner, alert the name.

// How to win?

//1. Whichever player is able to get 3 of their variables in a row wins. Row has a flexible meaning, it can be up, down or diagnol. As long as the variables are connected to eachother.

//2. Possibilty of a tie. If players are unable to create a row, the game ends in a tie. Maybe add an alert that says Tied Game.

//3. I would have a score board somewhere in the page. Tic Tac Toe is a fun game & players will most likely play more than once. Make sure the scoreboard is keeping track of who is winning the game. Everytime a player wins, add +1 to the scoreboard. If it is a tie, don't add anything


//AFTER GAME ENDS

//1. Give the players an option to play again. Maybe set an alert and say, play again? I would also give them the option to choose another variable. Maybe they want to be X now instead of O.
