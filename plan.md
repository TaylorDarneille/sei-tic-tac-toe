### Part 1: Make a To-Do list

Write out a list of *all* the things you need to do to code this game. This can be as detailed or high-level, though we recommend the former. This is your first time planning an app, so just have fun and just see what you can come up with. There's no right way.

*Write TODO list here*
1. Make a 3x3 grid for the users to play the game on
2. Make variables for X and O
3. Give to the user the option to start with X or O
4. Once the user chooses it, give the option onto where the user wants to place the X or O
5. Once the first user chooses it place on the grid automatically assign the other charcter to the second user and give the current user the option to choose a spot on the grid
6. Whichever user wins, either make an alert stating they won or make something cool on the site.
7. Then give the option to either restart or play again

### Optional Part 2: Pseudo-code your win-logic

Each time a player makes a move, your code will check to see if there is a game-over condition (a win or a draw). Write out this logic in english/psuedocode below. When you're done, anyone should be able to read your pseudo-code and translate it line-by-line into javascript or another language.

*Write psuedocode here*
I think I would have to make functions for a win and a draw. Then whenever a move is made an iteration happens to determine which user won or if it is a draw.
