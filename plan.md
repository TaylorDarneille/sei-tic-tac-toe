# Peudo-Code Tic Tac Toe

Next Week, you'll be building a [tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) game from scratch. To prepare, the deliverable this week is to plan it out! You'll also get to practice writing [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## The Assignment

Fork & Clone this repo. Open this file in your text editor and fill in the sections below. When you're done, make a pull request!

### Part 1: Make a To-Do list

Write out a list of *all* the things you need to do to code this game. This can be as detailed or high-level, though we recommend the former. This is your first time planning an app, so just have fun and just see what you can come up with. There's no right way.

---
--Player one puts one x or o on the grid

*Write TODO list here*
--grid has to be equal size(length * width)
--make a function to decide who plays first
--must have a winner
--When either player's puts three x's or o's in a row(either way)on the grid they will be crown a winner
--what to do if there is a draw / what is a draw
--Player chooses what symbol they want to be x/o
--Playing sequence is alternating turns between Player's
--make a reset button to restart the game 
--
---

### Optional Part 2: Pseudo-code your win-logic

Each time a player makes a move, your code will check to see if there is a game-over condition (a win or a draw). Write out this logic in english/psuedocode below. When you're done, anyone should be able to read your pseudo-code and translate it line-by-line into javascript or another language.

*Write psuedocode here*

---Default function to check for a winner and a draw. If the condition are met let them know their result and reset the game 

---Function to decide who plays first
--Set variables for x and o.
--Function deciding Player's choice between x or o.
--Condition showing how every turn and round would be played.
