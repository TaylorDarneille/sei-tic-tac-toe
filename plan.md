# Peudo-Code Tic Tac Toe

Next Week, you'll be building a [tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) game from scratch. To prepare, the deliverable this week is to plan it out! You'll also get to practice writing [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## The Assignment

Fork & Clone this repo. Open this file in your text editor and fill in the sections below. When you're done, make a pull request!

### Part 1: Make a To-Do list

Write out a list of *all* the things you need to do to code this game. This can be as detailed or high-level, though we recommend the former. This is your first time planning an app, so just have fun and just see what you can come up with. There's no right way.

*Write TODO list here*

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
2. You are X, your friend (or the computer) is O. Or vice versa.
3. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares on the grids.
4. Part of your strategy is trying to figure out how to get three Xs in a row. 5.5. The other part is trying to figure out how to stop the other player or the computer from getting three Os in a row.
6. If the other player or computer gets two Os in a row, you have to put your next X in the last empty square in that row to stop the player or the computer from winning. 
7. The first player to get 3 of thier marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
8. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

### Optional Part 2: Pseudo-code your win-logic

Each time a player makes a move, your code will check to see if there is a game-over condition (a win or a draw). Write out this logic in english/psuedocode below. When you're done, anyone should be able to read your pseudo-code and translate it line-by-line into javascript or another language.
