# Peudo-Code Tic Tac Toe

Next Week, you'll be building a [tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) game from scratch. To prepare, the deliverable this week is to plan it out! You'll also get to practice writing [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## The Assignment

Fork & Clone this repo. Open this file in your text editor and fill in the sections below. When you're done, make a pull request!

### Part 1: Make a To-Do list

Write out a list of *all* the things you need to do to code this game. This can be as detailed or high-level, though we recommend the former. This is your first time planning an app, so just have fun and just see what you can come up with. There's no right way.

*Write TODO list here*

--- Obj: two players go turn for turn with one player having x and the other having o on a 3 by 3 grid. The first player to get 3 in a row no matter if itâ€™s up down left right or even diagonally wins the game. If a player chose a spot that is already taken do not let the user take that spot.

1. make a 3 by 3 grid
2. grid should be divs...clickable divs
3. two players max
4. switch turns back and forth
5. give the option for the player to choose x or o with x going first
6. give the user the option to choose a spot on the grid to place x
7. let the next player choose a placement for the o
8. first person to get 3 in a row wins
9. Can win left to right, top to bottom or even diagonally.
10. Lets the user know who won the game.
11. Restart game after winner is declared


### Optional Part 2: Pseudo-code your win-logic

Each time a player makes a move, your code will check to see if there is a game-over condition (a win or a draw). Write out this logic in english/psuedocode below. When you're done, anyone should be able to read your pseudo-code and translate it line-by-line into javascript or another language.
