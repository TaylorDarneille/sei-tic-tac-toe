# Peudo-Code Tic Tac Toe

Next Week, you'll be building a [tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) game from scratch. To prepare, the deliverable this week is to plan it out! You'll also get to practice writing [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## The Assignment

Fork & Clone this repo. Open this file in your text editor and fill in the sections below. When you're done, make a pull request!

### Part 1: Make a To-Do list

Write out a list of *all* the things you need to do to code this game. This can be as detailed or high-level, though we recommend the former. This is your first time planning an app, so just have fun and just see what you can come up with. There's no right way.

1. Make a grid that is 3 squares by 3 squares to play tic-tac-toe on
2. Make a 2 variables. One for X and one for O
3. Give the user the option to pick either X or O as their game piece.
4. After that, allow the player to choose where they would like to place their first piece.
5. After that user selects their first position, allow the second user to select a spot of their own. They will have automatically been assigned the other game pieces (x or 0).
6. Continue to play the game until 1 player has 3 game pieces in a row. Either vertically, horizontally or diagnaly.
7. The winning user will be alerted that they have won, else the loser will be alerted that they have lost. 
8. Give the option to either restart the game or exit.

### Optional Part 2: Pseudo-code your win-logic

Each time a player makes a move, your code will check to see if there is a game-over condition (a win or a draw). Write out this logic in english/psuedocode below. When you're done, anyone should be able to read your pseudo-code and translate it line-by-line into javascript or another language.

*Write psuedocode here*
They will be an else if statement that is checking to see if there is 3 of the same character in a row. Either vertically sideways or diagnally.
