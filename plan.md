# Peudo-Code Tic Tac Toe

Next Week, you'll be building a [tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) game from scratch. To prepare, the deliverable this week is to plan it out! You'll also get to practice writing [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## The Assignment

Fork & Clone this repo. Open this file in your text editor and fill in the sections below. When you're done, make a pull request!

### Part 1: Make a To-Do list

Write out a list of *all* the things you need to do to code this game. This can be as detailed or high-level, though we recommend the former. This is your first time planning an app, so just have fun and just see what you can come up with. There's no right way.

*Write TODO list here*
1. make square grid with the smallest size being 3x3 up to a grid of 5x5
2. make a user choice prompt and computer choice of either x or o with different/contrasting colors (ie: red for x and blue for o)
3. make a button for the start of a new game
4. make an alert to let user know who's turn it is
5. ability for game to provide hints for user when playing the game if they are stuck
6. alert user when the game ends with who wins or if the game is a tie and the option for user to start a new game if possible
7. make a score chart of the wins and losses for the user to keep track
8. making sure that the user knows what game they are playing and how to play it
9. making sure the square in the grid is marked with the user choice or computer choice
10. giving user option to choose size of the grid they want to play on

### Optional Part 2: Pseudo-code your win-logic

Each time a player makes a move, your code will check to see if there is a game-over condition (a win or a draw). Write out this logic in english/psuedocode below. When you're done, anyone should be able to read your pseudo-code and translate it line-by-line into javascript or another language.

*Write psuedocode here*
//if user has 3 x's or o's in a row then user wins and computer loses
//if computer has 3 x's or o's in a row then computer wins and user loses
//if user or computer are unable to get 3 x's or o's in a row then it is a tie
//repeat previous steps for 5x5 grid
