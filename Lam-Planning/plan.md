# Peudo-Code Tic Tac Toe

Next Week, you'll be building a [tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) game from scratch. To prepare, the deliverable this week is to plan it out! You'll also get to practice writing [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## The Assignment

Fork & Clone this repo. Open this file in your text editor and fill in the sections below. When you're done, make a pull request!

### Part 1: Make a To-Do list

Write out a list of *all* the things you need to do to code this game. This can be as detailed or high-level, though we recommend the former. This is your first time planning an app, so just have fun and just see what you can come up with. There's no right way.

*Write TODO list here*

The Set Up 
1. create html, js, css files
2. work on html first & get the boilerplate down
    2.a add the css & js src links
    2.b console log & add a body bg 
3. test out to see if everything is linked by opening up the html

The Coding
1. look over the programming principles, with focus on the nine provided in the combining-data-types-callbacks-deliverable: 
    - DRY
    - KISS
    - Avoid creating a YAGNI
    - Do the simplest thing that could possibly work
    - Don't make me think
    - Write code for the maintainer
    - Single responsibility principle
    - Avoid premature optimization
    - Separation of concerns
2. develop user stories to maintain good form for overall design + how detailed (or not detailed) the instructions should be
3. double check the pseudo-code for more context on: 
    - list of variables & constants
    - list of functions (really parse out what kind of functions would be appropriate/needed)
4. write out the code
    - flesh out the html in guidance with the structural framework of the game
        - utilize wireframing methods & mockups 
    - write out the javascript, utilizing dom best practices
    - interchangeably work through CSS to be in line with design frameworks & mockups
5. check the work (throughout the coding process as well)
6. play the game to make sure it works
7. garner feedback from groups of test users 
    - input feedback as data for further review & revisions

### Optional Part 2: Pseudo-code your win-logic

Each time a player makes a move, your code will check to see if there is a game-over condition (a win or a draw). Write out this logic in english/psuedocode below. When you're done, anyone should be able to read your pseudo-code and translate it line-by-line into javascript or another language.
